Work at WeDemand! - Front end developer
=======================================

Basic Instructions
------------------

    1. Fork this repository
    2. Implement an HTML page based on the PSD in assets directory
    3. Submit a pull request with your changes

Requirements
------------

    * The counter on "next monthly winner in" must be fully functional.
    * The page must work on Safari, Chrome and Firefox. IE is a bonus. :)
    * Progressive enhancement and graceful degradation are fine.

What we're gonna evaluate
-------------------------

The objective of this test is to have an overall idea of what you know
about HTML, CSS, Javascript and the tools you're gonna use everyday.
Specifically:

    * Correct usage of HTML elements and attributes
    * CSS organization and legibility - preprocessors like SASS and
      LESS are fine (but they aren't a requirement)
    * Skill level in Javascript: vanilla gives you extra points, but
      don't compromise the test just because of this
    * Legibility of your code
    * Readability of your commit messages
    * The page doesn't need to be implemented "pixel perfect", although
      try to do it matching the layout as close as possible.

Extra points:

    * Code and commits in english
    * Smaller commits, with a contained unit of work
    * Effects - use with caution!
